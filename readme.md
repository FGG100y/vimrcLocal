## Tree command in git-bash

1. Download and extract the tree.exe ([tree-1.5.2.2-bin.zip](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/tree-1.5.2.2-bin.zip))

2. Copy the tree.exe to 'path-to-your/Git/usr/bin' e.g., I install the Git
   program to D:/Git, so I copy the tree.exe to D:/Git/usr/bin.

3. reopen your git-bash. tree command now should work well. If not, have a look
   at [this answer in StackExchange](https://superuser.com/questions/531592/how-do-i-add-the-tree-command-to-git-bash-on-windows)
